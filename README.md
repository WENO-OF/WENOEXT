# WENO framework

Weighted essentially non-oscillatory library for the framework of OpenFOAM.
Detailed information about the theoretical background and the implementation can 
be found in:

 * [J. W. Gärtner, A. Kronenburg, T. Martin, Efficient WENO library for OpenFOAM, SoftwareX, 2020](./documentation/Gaertner2020.pdf)
 * [T. Martin and I. Shevchuk, Implementation and Validation of Semi-Implicit WENO Schemes Using OpenFOAM, Computation, 2018](./documentation/Martin2018.pdf)

A quick overview of the WENO scheme is provided in this presentation:

## Installation

1. Clone the directory with
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/WENO-OF/WENOEXT.git`

2. Execute `Allwmake` to build the library
   The compilation of the library uses cmake instead of wmake files!

### Options

Parallel compilation can be activated with:
`./Allwmake -j <# of cores>`
if the number of cores is omitted, it is determined automatically.

On the master branch only clean git commits can be compiled. 
If a dirty git state shall be compiled the `-f|--force` option has to be used
on the master branch. 

### CMake Options

Several options can be set over CMake commands with,
```bash
./Allwmake -D<CMAKE_OPTION>
```

|Cmake Command |Options| Description |
|:-----------------------|:---------|:----------------|
|MARCH_NATIVE    |ON/OFF | Activates `march=native` flag. Default ON </br> Use this flag if you get an "illegal instruction error" during execution.|
|USE_LAPACK        |ON/OFF| Use LAPACK library for matrix operations such as eigen values</br>If switched on, check with the [WENO-PerformanceTests](https://github.com/WENO-OF/WENO-PerformanceTests) if the performance improves or decreases.|
|USE_FMA|ON/OFF|Use std::fma for WENO math functions. Default ON|
|CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE|Release/Debug/None|When the debug option is selected the OpenFOAM FULLDEBUG flag is activated|

Commands not listed in the table are forwarded to cmake, allowing to use all standard CMake commands.

### Note to GNU compiler:

GNU compiler version must be higher than 7. For g++ < v7 an error is reported for 
the specialisation template syntax. 
The syntax in the code is according to C++11 standard which is available for g++ v7 and higher. 
 

## Usage

To use the WENO scheme you have to add the library to your controlDict by editing `system/controlDict`

    libs("libWENOEXT.so")

Within your `system/fvSchemes` file,

    divSchemes
    {
        div(phi,U) 	Gauss WENOUpwindFit 2 1;
    }

Here the first index '2' represents the order of the WENO scheme and the second index can be either
'1' for bounded or '0' for unbounded.

Further options can be set in the WENODict located in the 'system/' folder:

### Specialized Version for Scalar Transport

The limited WENOUpwindFit scheme uses a cell limited approach known from other
schemes such as linearUpwind. For scalar transport in the range 0 to 1 a 
specialized scheme called *WENOUpwindFit01* is available. This schemes limits
the value using the limiter of Zhang and Shu.




## Tutorials

The code contains two tutorials from the standard cavity test. 
To run the tutorials execute `./Allrun` in the tutorial/ directory.

## Tests

Testing is performed with the CATCH2 framework. You can compile and execute the tests
by executing `./runTest` in the test directory. Further instructions are found in [here](tests/TestInstructions.md) 

## Contineous Integration

To check the code for different OpenFOAM implementations, e.g. OpenFOAM 8,
OpenFOAM v1912, etc. the code is copied into different docker containers
created with the Dockerfiles in `CI/`. In the docker container the code is compiled
and unit tests executed. 

Executing the tests is controlled over the Makefile in the root directory. The
different OpenFOAM versions can be tested with 

```
# Just executing make runs all tests
make

# For OpenFOAM v5.x
make runTestsOF5

# For OpenFOAM 8
make runTestsOF8
```

This implementation allows to have the same testing on the local and remote branch.
